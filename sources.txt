I am fairly new in the field of Data Science specially NLP and the how we about the hole process.

As a result throughout the project I followed/ took help from a number of Online Resources, Video Tutorials.
Below are the links to some of those resources which were the most helpful to me throughout the project, topic-wise.

1) DATA EXTRACTION & CLEANING.

A great article that simply talks what data is, what makes it good, what makes it bad etc.
https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-of-cleaning-your-data-b713dbd49726

This article is kind of an extension of above, and goes into a little more detail about the nuance of Data Cleaning.
(Also the article has great references for each individual aspect of data cleaning.

A very in-depth article which I found relatively easier to follow along than others online. (Also contains important Code Snippets)
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/03/text-data-preprocessing-walkthrough-python.html

2) Data Analysis
A YouTube Video link that focusses primarily on seaborn and matplotlib to plot graphs.

Another article which was very easy to follow along (the dataset it uses is also available, link in the article)
https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15

3) Data Training and Testing
A good starting point,
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-classifier-in-python-with-scikit-learn

These articles talks about how pipelining can be useful.
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/01/build-your-first-machine-learning-pipeline-using-scikit-learn/
https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-example-of-pipeline-in-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-e726ffbb6976

4) Creating a WebApp and deploying to Heroku
An excellent Flask Tutorial (Video Tutorial + Blog)
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Great Article which takes you through the whole process from start to finish

Apart from this, official documentation pages of praw, sklearn, rethinkDB were also quite useful for me!

praw: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
rethinkDB: https://rethinkdb.com/docs
